# CS-230 - Operating Systems

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
An Android puzzle competition game was launched by The Gaming Room, a mobile app game creation company with experience in developing games for mobile platforms. In order to make the game accessible across multiple platforms and devices, the client requested a web-based version of its current Android application.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
This section of my recommendation outlines key areas that the client should consider, such as the client's operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the advantages of using serverless architecture for product launch. It was my job to make a compelling argument as to why a cloud platform was the best choice for the client and their goals.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
In order to understand the structure and relationships between the entities representing the app components, it proved helpful to analyze the domain model as a UML class diagram. Thus, concise classes were developed with straightforward methods that were able to leverage other entities in a direct manner to create a clean prototype.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
A deeper dive into the nuances between platforms on the client side would improve the evaluation section comparing and contrasting popular operating systems (i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux) and mobile platforms. In terms of client-side concerns, the web browser is the primary engine that runs the application. There has been limited insight into the differences between operating systems for web-based solutions. The preference of operating systems for particular browsers (i.e. Windows to Edge, Mac to Safari, etc.) could be examined in greater detail to determine if non-favored browsers pose technological or performance challenges.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When developing web-based applications, it's crucial to prioritize user needs such as speed and intuitiveness (i.e. usability). While quality characteristics like the app's aesthetics are also significant, they take a backseat to the more critical aspects of speed and usability. Users might tolerate an app's appearance but won't hesitate to abandon it if its functionality is unclear or sluggish. The primary focus on user needs stems from their role as the app's consumers – their satisfaction directly contributes to the client's revenue.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When approaching software design, initiate with a broad perspective and gradually refine towards specificity. Begin with overarching goals and iterate through different phases to arrive at the definitive solution. For instance, a client's business objectives can be deconstructed into functional requirements, outlining essential functionalities to achieve those objectives. These functional requirements can be further subdivided into technical requirements, delineating the technical strategies for realizing those functionalities. Translating technical requirements into design documents, architecture, and code culminates in the realization of the final solution.
